P2K (Part 1):
## P2K is a voice-controlled music queuing interface.

Playlist2000 uses Windows Speech Recognition combined with the Vocola voice command language to implement an interface that creates a "jukebox-like" media player control system.  Behind the application is a Python programming interface to convert the queue-based verbal instructions to Windows batch scripts that then play songs in their specified order.

### Goal

Our program aims to simplify music selection and playlist creation for everyone.  Our vision is to eventually replace tediously repetitive tasks with an easy-to-use voice command interface.  Starting with something as simple as controlling music playback, we can broaden this idea to encompass the many aspects of daily life (calendar/event planning, home security, cooking preparation, social media interaction, etc.).
